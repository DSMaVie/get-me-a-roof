# Get me a Roof

This little demo is used to generate requests for job listings on (selected) german flat listing portals using AI.

## Notes

* Immoscout is not easy to crawl and parse. Even with selenium the captchas disallow direct usage of the page. with copy and paste of raw html it works.
  however, my parsing code is not very stable atm.
* work on llm interface next.
* hosting with <fly.io>
